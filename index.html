      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker, Inc. is the creator of the Docker container tool focused on making it easier to create, deploy, and run applications. Docker is an open-source project designed to package software into containers allowing the application to run on other Linux machines regardless of settings.<sup>1</sup> “A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.”<sup>2</sup> This means developers can focus on writing code without worrying about the system their application will run on.<sup>1</sup></p>

      <p>Docker has become extremely popular in recent years because unlike a virtual machine, which are resource intensive, containers use shared operating systems.3 Virtual machines use a copy of the operating system, application, binaries, and libraries, which can require gigabytes of space.<sup>2</sup> Containers use the same Linux kernel as the system they are running on meaning they take up significantly less space.<sup>1</sup></p>
