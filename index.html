      <h2>What is Docker</h2>

      <p>Docker, Inc. is the creator of the Docker container tool focused on making it easier to create, deploy, and run applications. Docker is an open-source project designed to package software into containers allowing the application to run on other Linux machines regardless of settings. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. This means developers can focus on writing code without worrying about the system their application will run on.</p>

      <p>Docker has become extremely popular in recent years because unlike a virtual machine, which are resource intensive, containers use shared operating systems. Virtual machines use a copy of the operating system, application, binaries, and libraries, which can require gigabytes of space.  Containers use the same Linux kernel as the system they are running on meaning they take up significantly less space.</p>

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>

      <p>NGINX is an open-source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. NGINX started as a web server with the goal of maximizing performance and stability. It was originally developed to tackle the C10K problem, which was a performance issue of handling 10,000 concurrent connections. NGINX roots in performance make it one of the fastest and most popular web servers on the market. Some notable companies using NGINX include Intuit, T-Mobile, Microsoft, IBM, Google, Adobe, Xerox, LinkedIn, Cisco, Facebook, Target, Twitter, Apple, Intel, and hundreds more. Over 319 million websites, with a majority of the top 100,000 busiest websites, rely on NGINX.</p>

      <p>Since its beginnings NGINX has continued to expand and evolve being used in many different capacities. It is capable of supporting all components of the web. With its ability to handle an extremely high volume of connections NGINX became commonly used as a reverse proxy and load balancer. NGINX has also been used as an SSL/TLS terminator or web accelerator. By acting as an intermediary it is able to manage tasks that could slow web servers.</p>

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>

      <p>A virtual machine is an application that gives the ability to run an operating system within another operating system. The virtual machine acts as a physical computer, but is run by the physical resources of the host computer. The virtual machine provides the same functionality as a physical computer, but in an easily portable package. Multiple virtual machines can be run at the same time on a single host computer.</p>
      
      <p>Virtual machines provide the ability to test applications on several different operating systems using the same physical hardware or contain the application within a safe environment that will not impact the host computer. They also the ability to run old applications that may no longer be compatible with newer operating systems.  Since one computer can run several virtual machines concurrently there is no longer a need for many physical machines that are underutilized.</p>
